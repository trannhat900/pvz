<h1>About Plants VS Zombies</h1>
<p>Inspired by the game Plants vs. Zombies, our group decided to create additional plant and zombie characters, as well as other features. 
  <br>Please note that this version is for learning and practice purposes only.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This project recreates the essence of Plants vs. Zombies, a strategy game where players use plants to defend their house from waves of zombies. It includes unique plant and zombie types, resource management, and dynamic gameplay mechanics. The project demonstrates teamwork and technical skills, culminating in a fully functional Java-based game, comprehensive documentation, and an engaging presentation.</p>

<h2>Rule</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The game is played on a 5x9 grid.</li>
  <li>Players collect "Sun Points" to purchase and plant different types of plants.</li>
  <li>Plants automatically attack zombies in their lane.</li>
  <li>Zombies move horizontally toward the player's house. If a zombie reaches the house, the game ends in a loss.</li>
  <li>Defeat all zombies to win the game.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to run</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Clone or download the project from the repository.</li>
  <li>Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the project directory.</li>
  <li>Run the following command to compile the code:
    <pre><code>javac -d bin src/*.java</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Run the game with:
    <pre><code>java -cp bin GameWindow</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Preview</h2>
